in the path where the ts file resides:

run: npx tsc .\[filename].ts

Then once the js file is compiled, you can run it by:

run: node .\[filename].js

IF a tsconfig json file is created in the path, then just running tsc without the file name will also work, by default it will include all the ts files when building

Running a script:

run: npm run build
